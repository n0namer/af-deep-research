6.  **Address Knowledge Gaps**: If the confidence assessment indicates areas of uncertainty, consider creating themes that acknowledge these gaps while presenting what is known.
7.  **Create Planning Directives**: For each cluster, write a concise `planning_directive` that instructs a section planner on the goal for that cluster, ensuring it contributes to answering the original query.
8.  **Propose a Title**: Create an insightful title for the entire knowledge map that reflects the original research intent.

    -   **Precision**: Use precise, unambiguous language. Construct clear, grammatically correct sentences that convey complex information efficiently.

    -   **Use Tables for Structure**: When presenting structured comparisons (e.g., pros/cons, features of different products, quantitative data), render the information in a Markdown table for scannability.
    -   **Use Lists for Clarity**: For enumerating key findings, action items, or recommendations, always use bulleted or numbered lists.
    -   **Use Blockquotes for Impact**: Isolate powerful quotes, critical assumptions, or a key takeaway conclusion from a paragraph using blockquotes to make it stand out.
    -   **Use Sub-Headings for Organization**: For longer, more complex sections, use `###` Markdown sub-headings to break up the content into logical, digestible parts.

3.  **Apply the Style Guide**: Write the content for your section in rich Markdown, applying the principles from the `<markdown_usage_philosophy>`.
4.  **Cite Meticulously**: You **MUST** insert the corresponding `citation` marker (e.g., `[1]`, `[2]`) immediately after the sentence or clause it supports. Group citations where appropriate (e.g., `[1, 3, 4]`).
5.  **Formatting**: Ensure all Markdown is valid. Do not include the main section title (`##`), as it will be added programmatically.

<instructions>
1.  **Set the Narrative Scope**: Use `analysis_depth` to determine the length and scope of the document.\n{depth_instructions.get(analysis_depth.lower(), depth_instructions['analytical_brief'])}
2.  **Assign Evidence Strategically**: Select the most critical fact_ids that support each section's goal.
3.  **Create Section Directives**: Devise a logical flow of sections. For each section:
    - Give it a clear, compelling title.
    - Assign the most relevant `fact_id`s from the available evidence.
    - Write detailed `writing_instructions` for a writer, guiding them on the analytical goal, tone, and suggested Markdown structures (like `###` sub-headings or tables).
4.  **Propose a Document Title**: Create a compelling, top-level title for the entire document This title should be inspired from the initial query and the kind of information we have and what we are trying to convey. Think about New York Journal or Wall Street post like title or top research article like title. Take inspiration from various places and we are going to write it like that. Write like a professional journalist or appropriate to the field and don't write it like AI. this should not contain things like "-" or ":" or \em dash etc..
